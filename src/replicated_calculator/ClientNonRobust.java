/**
 * A simple, non-robust client for connecting to DistributedCalculator. 
 * It sends the events to the calculator and receives back the events as 
 * acknowledgements. Only the acknowledgements of read events are used
 * for anything, as they carry the value which was read. This value is 
 * reported back to the caller of the SimpleClient using a callback.
 * 
 * A fuller implementation could, e.g., handle detection of when a server
 * is down and report back to the user which commands were carried out.
 * If the server crashes the client could try to shift to another 
 * server in the server group.
 * 
 * A fuller implementation could also make the client robust such that 
 * it can handle to crash and then restart.
 * 
 * A fuller implementation could also be extended to handle a client-centric
 * semantics such as read-your-writes in case the client disconnects from one
 * server and then connects to another server.
